# Amazon Website Clone

Welcome to my Amazon Website Clone repository! This project was created as a learning exercise to replicate the layout and functionality of the Amazon website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below you'll find details about the project and the key learnings I gained during its development.

## Project Overview:

- **Objective**: Clone the layout and functionality of the Amazon website.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Pages**:
  - `amazon.html`: Home page.
  - `cart.html`: View cart page.
  - `order.html`: Order summary page.
  - `tracking.html`: Tracking page.

## Key Learnings:

- **Grid Layout**: Utilized CSS grid for arranging products and other elements on the page, gaining a deeper understanding of grid layout techniques.
- **Positioning**: Experimented with relative and absolute positioning to place elements precisely where needed, enhancing my understanding of CSS positioning.
- **JavaScript Rendering**: Leveraged JavaScript to dynamically render products using template strings, reducing redundancy in HTML code and improving maintainability.
- **Array Manipulation**: Stored products as an array with unique IDs and used JavaScript array methods like `forEach` for rendering and styling, leading to cleaner and more efficient code.
- **Multi-Page Website**: Created multiple HTML files for different pages, allowing for a seamless user experience across various sections of the website.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the desired HTML file (e.g., `amazon.html`, `cart.html`, etc.) in your web browser to view the corresponding page.
3. Explore the website and interact with the features implemented.
